This is an SVM implementation with numpy and the quadratic programming framework CVXOPT.

The implementation includes an SVM module with Linear and Gaussian kernels and a test to showcase its abillity to classify data.

Two test cases are shown. One with linearly separable data:

And one with non=linearly seaprable data:
